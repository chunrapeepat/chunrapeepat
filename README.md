Hello! I'm Chun, an indie hacker and Web3 contributor who enjoys building fun stuff on the internet.
- I'm currently taking a gap year from my full-time job to start my indie hacker journey and dive into the topics I'm interested in.
- I'm also contributing to various DAOs ([Uniswap](https://unigrants.org/), [Gitcoin](http://gitcoin.co/), [Develeper DAO](https://www.developerdao.com/))
- I previously worked at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) and [Cleverse](https://cleverse.com/) as a software engineer.
- I'm mastering things by building little projects e.g. [Uniswap Calculator](https://uniswapv3.thechun.dev/), [ETHTalk](https://ethtalk.app/), [The Score Programming Language](https://github.com/chunza2542/score-language), and [more](https://github.com/chunza2542?tab=repositories).
- I actively tweet about what I've learned and what I've built. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chunza2542)
- Current hobbies: reading a book ([visit my bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/148571752-chun?utf8=%E2%9C%93&shelf=read&title=chun&sort=avg_rating&order=d)), jogging, meditation, [bloging](https://medium.com/chunza2542), and playing guitar (meet my heros: [Tommy Emmanuel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Khi2xaBTI4), [Joe Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zszIWqY3F2Q), [Sungha Jung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkRsz7didXI))
- Pronouns: he/him
- Fun Fact: I first got interested in computers because I want to customize my Window 2000 to look cool.
